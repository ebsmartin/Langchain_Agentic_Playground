I'm a Software Engineer at 1Inch. We're trying to make it easier for users to control their own data using blockchain. How about you, Jamie?\nPerson A: That's fascinating! I'm on the other side of the coin, so to speak. I'm an Associate Market Analyst at 1Inch. I spend my days tracking trends, tokenomics, and trying to predict the next big wave. So, less building, more observing.\nPerson B: Ah, a market guru! We definitely need more people like you to make sense of all this chaos. It's interesting, your analysis probably informs the kind of projects that get traction, which then impacts what developers like me build.\nPerson A: Exactly! It's all interconnected. I've been particularly interested in the intersection of NFTs and real-world asset tokenization lately. Seems like a huge potential area.\nPerson B: Totally agree. We've actually been exploring how decentralized identity could play a role in verifying ownership of tokenized assets. Makes the whole process more secure and transparent.\nPerson A: That's a great point. We should definitely connect. I'd love to hear more about your project and how DID can be applied there. Maybe we could grab a coffee tomorrow morning before the sessions start?\nPerson B: Sounds like a plan, Eric. I'm free around 8:30. Let's exchange contact info. Here's my LinkedIn QR code.\nPerson A: Perfect. Just scanned it. I'll send you a message. Looking forward to it!\n",
